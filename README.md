###Random Robot Chat Box using CRUD

After Completing My Javascript Developmental Course I recreated one of the projects that we worked on. The Original project that we made was
a Note Taking App, we used Google Firebase to hold the incoming data.

The lesson being taught was about CRUD and our instructor explained how to connect the database and to use the user's input to add a new note the list.

I then was able to take the same methods to use create my own version of a chatbox with a robot that has been given pre-written phrases after the user clicks on "Submit"
